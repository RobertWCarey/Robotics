Describe what happens when the heuristic cost weight is above 1.0.
Try various start and goal positions, and various weight values.

ANSWER HERE:
By increasing the heuristic cost weight above 1.0 the number of nodes in the closed set is reduced.
However in most cases, particularly when there is an obstical in between the start and goal, this results in a longer resultant path length.

This means that we can increase the heuristic cost weight to reduce the time taken to find a path. 
However, this is more likely to result in a path that is longer than the optimal path.
